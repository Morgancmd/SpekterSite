<h2><b><i>About Spekter</i></b></h2>
Hi, I'm Spekter. A Youtube content creator that primarily covers video games on my channel. Right now, there isn't much to talk about,<br> 
as I'm still finding my creative footing. With any luck, however, that should be changing in the near future. I've definitely got some <br>
plans for the future, and I'd love to have you along for the ride.<br><br>
